# HIGH-LEVEL PROJECT SUMMARY

We develope the Online 3D Space simulator. It simulates Moon with the spheres pointing to position of Moonquakes. Also you can see the information about quake such as position, magnitude, depth and you can see the soundwave picture and listen to the sonification of quake. The database of moonquakes can be easily extended with new data and automatically prceed to Simulator. In the future this project can be easilly extended to all bodies of the Solar system. It can help visually represent different events in the our Universe.
